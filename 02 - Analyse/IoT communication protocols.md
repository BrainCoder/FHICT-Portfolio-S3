# IoT communication protocols
For our project we need an IoT backend protocol to faccilitate the communication between our devices and our services. Too select the most appropiate protocol for this task we have researched and documented the 3 most common choices.

## Protocols
### HTTP RESTfull
**The HyperText Transfer Protocol** (**HTTP**) is widely used as a document-centric protocol that transmits messages which are formatted as webpages requested by the client from the Server. It operates on TCP/IP and supports TLS (Transport Layer Security) in the form of HTTPs. Itâ€™s widely used in client-server models for REST API between two different platforms or interfaces.

### MQTT
 **Message Queuing Telemetry Transport** (**MQTT**) is an open and standard lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol that transports messages between devices. The protocol usually runs over TCP; however, any network protocol that provides ordered, lossless, bi-directional connections can support MQTT. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required and/or the network bandwidth is limited.

### CoAP
**Constrained Application Protocol** (**CoAP**) is an IoT protocol for use on constrained devices. CoAP is based on the popular REST model making it easy to learn for people allready familiar with this technology.

## Comparison matrix
| Feature  | HTTP  | MQTT  | CoAP  |
|---|---|---|---|
| **UDP/TCP**  | TCP | TCP  | UDP  |
| **Ease of use**  | High | High | Medium |
| **Bandwidth consumption**  | High | Low | Low |
| **Energy efficent**  | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Not blocked by firewall / NAT**  | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Flexible**  | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Secure**  | No<sup>1</sup> | No<sup>1</sup> | Yes |
| **Easy to maintain**  | Yes | Yes | Maybe |
| **Reliability**  | High | High<sup>2</sup> | Medium |
| **Realtime**  | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Scalable**  | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Open Standard**  | Yes | Yes | Yes |

<sup>1</sup> Can be made secure using TLS.
<sup>2</sup> Reliability can be selected using 3 QoS levels.

## Conclusion
Due to the requirements of our project and the skill level within our team. We have decided that MQTT is the best option for this project. The main deciding factors where its **Energy efficency, Ease of use, NAT support & Realtime communication**.
