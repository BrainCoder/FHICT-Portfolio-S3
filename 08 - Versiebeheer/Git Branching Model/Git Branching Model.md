# Git Branching Model

## Problem
The company I work for decided to make their development process more profecional and I was tasked with researching different branching models and picking the correct one and writing a document explaining it to new people.

## Plan


## Result
During my investigation I came to the conclusion that gitflow is not the one size fits all solution it's praised to be and highly inadequate for applications that have contiues deployment and only one version in production at a time. But because of the nature of our development process where multiple versions can be in production at the same time and the need to look up spesific versions in the future it is the right fit for us. I have writen a small primer for new employees as a guideline.
